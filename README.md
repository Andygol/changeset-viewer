# Changeset Plugin

This plugin allows you to see what the changes were in a certain place, you can list the changes by zones. 

The web version is [OSMCHA](https://osmcha.mapbox.com/), but since I am a fan of doing things fast in JOSM, I have implemented this plugin to see the changes that happened and do the mapping.


## Supported objects

Nodes, Ways (Relations in progress)
